"""
Core module for simulation application logic.

This module contains the core business logic for simulation processing:
- Flight schedule processing (storage & response)
- Show-up passenger processing (storage & response)
- Run simulation processing (storage & response)

Each core module combines both storage (parquet saving) and response (JSON formatting)
functionality in a single file with two classes.
